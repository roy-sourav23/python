# OOP Exercise 3: Create a child class Bus that will 
# inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class

# Given:
# class Vehicle:
#     def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
#         self.name = name
#         self.max_speed = max_speed
#         self.mileage = mileage

# Create a Bus object that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the parent Vehicle class and display it.

# Expected Output:
# Vehicle Name: School Volvo Speed: 180 Mileage: 12

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

school_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 180, 12)
print(f"Vehicle Name: {school_bus.name} Speed: {school_bus.max_speed} Mileage: {school_bus.mileage}")
